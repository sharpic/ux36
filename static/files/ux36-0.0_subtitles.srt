00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:08,580
Hi, I'm Simon and I will

2
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,330
be taking you through

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:12,930
this UX course for this

4
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:15,630
next semester. So this is

5
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,790
User Experience (UX 36),

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,080
the reason why we call it

7
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:20,580
UX 36 is because it's a

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:24,090
36,000 feet view of the

9
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:25,470
whole user experience

10
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:27,270
landscape. The idea is

11
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,110
that you'll get a broad

12
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:29,130
overview of user

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,390
experience, but it won't

14
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:32,970
be some deep dive because

15
00:00:32,970 --> 00:00:34,230
you'd need a whole course

16
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:34,920
to do that a whole

17
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,880
programme to do that, in

18
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,600
fact. So, let me welcome

19
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,220
you to this refresh

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,610
video. And so you might

21
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,720
be asking, Well, why are

22
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:47,160
we refreshing? Well,

23
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:48,150
obviously we're

24
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,490
refreshing for COVID-19

25
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:51,030
that's why you're

26
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:52,200
watching a video of this

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,020
not me in  person. To

28
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:57,090
refresh happens for the

29
00:00:57,090 --> 00:00:57,960
user experience course

30
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,950
probably every year with

31
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,270
minor updates Things

32
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:01,710
change all the time. So

33
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:03,270
see really good idea to

34
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:06,330
be able to refresh just

35
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,060
what you're doing. But

36
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:10,410
it's time for a major

37
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,490
refresh. And it's been

38
00:01:11,550 --> 00:01:12,570
time for a major refresh

39
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:13,830
for a year or two, I

40
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:14,640
thought that we could do

41
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:15,570
some more and add some

42
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:16,740
more little bits to give

43
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:18,060
you a good broad

44
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:19,200
understanding of user

45
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:20,430
experience and where it

46
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:21,930
is now. This course was

47
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,430
written six years ago,

48
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,740
things change. And so

49
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,180
some, some big updates

50
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,290
need to be need to be

51
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:29,850
gone through. And I did

52
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:32,100
plan to do this on the

53
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:34,170
sort of next year. So

54
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:39,030
next September 21-22. But

55
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,770
obviously, with COVID-19,

56
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:42,330
lockdown as hastened

57
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,320
these changes, so

58
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,490
therefore, it's useful to

59
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:46,020
just make this a gigantic

60
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,730
update all in one go. So

61
00:01:47,730 --> 00:01:48,630
that's what we're doing.

62
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:49,920
It's going to be a large

63
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:52,980
update for the entire

64
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:55,200
course, for this year, so

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,040
you're kind of lucky that

66
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,970
you've got this entire

67
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,240
update all in one go. The

68
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,290
unit's expanded, so it's

69
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:03,900
become more complete. So

70
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,190
for instance, we're doing

71
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,560
things on digital

72
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,640
phenotyping, which we'll

73
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:09,900
get to but this wasn't

74
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,830
included in the prior

75
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,270
work, as you'll see,

76
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,970
also, the course itself

77
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:16,500
will be included as a

78
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,770
GitHub repo. And that's

79
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,580
because a lot of people

80
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:21,840
say they want to clone

81
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:22,800
that repo so that they

82
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,910
can use it when they

83
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,500
leave the university so

84
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,940
that the stuff doesn't go

85
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,870
away. And so therefore, I

86
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:31,560
thought it was best to

87
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,430
kind of make a large

88
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,540
change, you'll still be

89
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:34,560
doing your assignments,

90
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,150
etc, on Blackboard as

91
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,530
you're used to. But for

92
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,710
this point, the major

93
00:02:40,710 --> 00:02:42,960
meat of the of the of the

94
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,700
update is going to be on

95
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,310
GitHub. It will be on

96
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:48,840
GitHub Pages for the

97
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:49,860
website, and then you can

98
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:51,030
just clone that entire

99
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:53,340
repo, get everything that

100
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,270
you need to get including

101
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,140
the videos etc, etc. And

102
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,910
there's also been changes

103
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:00,990
to The definition of what

104
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,190
user experience is, now

105
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:03,330
we'll get to this in more

106
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:05,820
detail later on, but it's

107
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:06,840
really important to

108
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,660
understand that we really

109
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:11,310
need to make sure that we

110
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:13,080
understand what UX is,

111
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,640
what user experience is,

112
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:16,380
what the user experience

113
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:17,910
is not what the user

114
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,380
experience designer is,

115
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,000
product design, visual

116
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:21,900
design. So all these

117
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,800
things have kind of

118
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,740
competing, mind space, if

119
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:28,320
you like, for people in

120
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:29,730
the area. And so it's a

121
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,660
good thing in some ways,

122
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,620
because nobody really

123
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,580
knows what it is. So we

124
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,310
can kind of make user

125
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,860
experience ours. But also

126
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:38,850
it can be confusing

127
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,200
unless you explicitly

128
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:42,990
decide to kind of

129
00:03:42,990 --> 00:03:44,280
understand what UX is

130
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,990
define what UX is for you

131
00:03:45,990 --> 00:03:46,680
personally.

132
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:51,100
Changes for version four.

133
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:51,940
So the reason why it's

134
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:52,990
version four is because

135
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,830
they we've been through a

136
00:03:53,830 --> 00:03:56,320
number of large version

137
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:58,960
changes and so this is a

138
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:00,460
this is a main Version

139
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,600
change. But there's also

140
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,440
been lots of little

141
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,960
changes where, you know,

142
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:06,220
for typos and those kind

143
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:06,850
of things, which

144
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,540
actually, students send

145
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:11,440
emails about all the

146
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:12,220
time, you know, there's a

147
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,630
typo here. Can we change

148
00:04:13,630 --> 00:04:14,410
this? Can we change that

149
00:04:14,410 --> 00:04:15,370
and of course we do over

150
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:17,620
time. And there's some

151
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:18,310
reordering of the

152
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:19,330
material from the last

153
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,320
time because I thought

154
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,300
that it could do with a

155
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:23,530
refresh with these new

156
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:25,780
chapters that I'm adding

157
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:26,680
in these new lectures

158
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,880
that I'm adding some of

159
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:28,930
some of the material need

160
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:31,060
to be reordered. Some

161
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,680
changes in emphasis. So

162
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,570
for instance, I used to

163
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:38,170
do a full scale two hour

164
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,720
lecture on anatomy. And

165
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,370
really, you need to know

166
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:43,210
about anatomy, you need

167
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,860
to know that these kind

168
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:47,230
of aspects of the human

169
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,420
body and human behaviour

170
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,860
exist so that you can

171
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:53,200
write your code for them

172
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:55,570
better, but you don't

173
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,440
really need to know the

174
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:57,610
depth. So that's now gone

175
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:59,080
out and it's no it's kind

176
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,230
of contextual work. We've

177
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:03,160
got additional sections

178
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:04,630
on visual design, just

179
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:05,920
really just really to

180
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:07,210
give completeness so that

181
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:07,810
you understand what

182
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:08,530
again, what that is,

183
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:09,520
again, that's contextual.

184
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,110
So you want to kind of

185
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:12,010
look at it, but you don't

186
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,900
really need to have a

187
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,800
deeper understanding of

188
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,030
visual design, because

189
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,750
you're not visual

190
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,190
designers. You know, we

191
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,390
order that service in. So

192
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,380
we don't really need to

193
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:26,800
think about that. There

194
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,910
are sections, additional

195
00:05:27,910 --> 00:05:30,130
sections on UX design,

196
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,330
what graphic design is

197
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,170
the nature of product

198
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,100
design, these kinds of

199
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:34,690
things. And I've also

200
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:35,860
reintegrated the UX

201
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,330
development overview now,

202
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:39,550
in previous years, I

203
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:41,170
started off with this

204
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:41,950
thing called developing

205
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:42,790
under the umbrella which

206
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,930
was really about how to

207
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:44,800
develop for user

208
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,750
experience if you were a

209
00:05:46,750 --> 00:05:49,240
developer, but also, how

210
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:50,260
you might speak to

211
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,190
developers about best

212
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,000
practice for user

213
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,110
experience when it comes

214
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:54,250
to development. You know,

215
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,780
because it's a complete

216
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,740
system. Obviously, the

217
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:57,580
Agile process is a

218
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:00,370
complete system. Remove

219
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:01,180
that, because I thought,

220
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,110
well, actually, you guys

221
00:06:02,110 --> 00:06:03,160
already are computer

222
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:03,970
scientists already

223
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:04,690
software engineers, you

224
00:06:04,690 --> 00:06:05,980
know, you know all this

225
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:07,210
information. But then I

226
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,440
was asked to bring it

227
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,090
back after a couple of

228
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,050
years. And also, I've

229
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:12,010
updated it with some

230
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,270
additional aspects of

231
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:17,860
MVC. So model view

232
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:19,690
controller architectures,

233
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,950
but more importantly of

234
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:21,820
micro services

235
00:06:21,820 --> 00:06:23,140
architectures and DevOps.

236
00:06:23,410 --> 00:06:24,160
I decided to bring this

237
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:24,940
back, because these are

238
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,440
awesome ways of

239
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:28,150
integrating user

240
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,110
experience into

241
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:30,190
continuous development

242
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,570
life cycles, and also

243
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,950
into the architectures

244
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:34,300
that arise from those.

245
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,190
You'll see that in the UX

246
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,150
development part, we're

247
00:06:37,150 --> 00:06:38,260
talking about separation

248
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:39,310
of concerns, and that

249
00:06:39,310 --> 00:06:40,570
separation of concerns is

250
00:06:40,570 --> 00:06:42,100
really important for us

251
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:44,560
to to understand. Now.

252
00:06:45,670 --> 00:06:47,680
That's all come back. And

253
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,430
so we'll be going through

254
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,390
that at the very end. But

255
00:06:49,390 --> 00:06:50,590
also we've got some other

256
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:54,220
aspects on prototyping

257
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,120
because people wanted a

258
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,050
bit more or to understand

259
00:06:56,050 --> 00:06:57,130
a bit more on prototyping

260
00:06:57,130 --> 00:06:57,970
what that is and rapid

261
00:06:57,970 --> 00:06:58,900
application development

262
00:06:58,900 --> 00:06:59,710
what that is and how it

263
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,360
fits in. There's also

264
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,740
some light statistics and

265
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,430
when I say light

266
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,450
statistics, I mean very

267
00:07:04,450 --> 00:07:05,440
light statistics. It's

268
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:07,240
mostly me ranting. Okay,

269
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:08,530
so do not worry about

270
00:07:08,530 --> 00:07:09,520
this. It's mostly me

271
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,560
talking a lot about

272
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,790
statistical analysis and

273
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,140
how we should be doing it

274
00:07:14,140 --> 00:07:15,460
and how you should make

275
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:16,300
sure that you understand

276
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,590
at least some aspects of

277
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,580
stats, even if there are

278
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:20,200
only a descriptive stats.

279
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:23,710
And there's a changing

280
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,090
topic title. So some of

281
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:26,170
the topic titles were a

282
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:32,050
little bit obscure. So

283
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:32,860
for instance, you know,

284
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,850
developing the umbrella,

285
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:34,420
what does that really

286
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:35,680
mean? So, you know, we've

287
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,400
changed it to make it

288
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,620
more explicit. Obviously,

289
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,730
there's video lectures,

290
00:07:39,760 --> 00:07:40,780
and there's also audio

291
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,700
podcasts. Now, I'm hoping

292
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,300
that we're going to put

293
00:07:43,300 --> 00:07:44,140
these video lectures in

294
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,370
audio podcast, as well as

295
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,530
being in the as well as

296
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:48,850
been in the GitHub repo,

297
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,140
some way to kind of

298
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:53,260
integrate them into third

299
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,700
party systems so that you

300
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,720
can actually listen to an

301
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:56,740
audio podcast on your

302
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,180
normal podcasting system.

303
00:07:58,330 --> 00:07:59,080
You don't have to do

304
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,890
anything different. It

305
00:07:59,890 --> 00:08:00,640
should just integrate

306
00:08:00,640 --> 00:08:01,630
into your life really,

307
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,090
the big change is that

308
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:05,020
we're going to be

309
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,820
removing the exam as the

310
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,710
key assessment method, or

311
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:09,880
at least the exam at the

312
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,870
end of the course that

313
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:12,250
you do in a normal exam

314
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:13,120
setting what we all think

315
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,170
of as an exam. Okay, so

316
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,580
that's the main thing

317
00:08:18,730 --> 00:08:20,080
that that kind of changes

318
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,500
here.

319
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,890
And what we're going to

320
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,670
have and we'll get to

321
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,740
this in the welcome talk

322
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:28,550
that I'll be giving

323
00:08:29,180 --> 00:08:31,340
shortly, when we get to

324
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:34,880
is a an exam that is kind

325
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,750
of more blended into the

326
00:08:35,750 --> 00:08:36,860
course. So we've we've

327
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:38,210
moved, we used to have

328
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:39,410
three assignments now we

329
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,000
have one formative

330
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,080
assignment, two summative

331
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,130
assignments, those are

332
00:08:43,130 --> 00:08:44,570
open book, you get the

333
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,440
assignment beforehand,

334
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,940
everything's good. We

335
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:48,860
then we then in the exam

336
00:08:48,860 --> 00:08:49,640
used to have some

337
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:50,330
multiple choice

338
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,920
questions, and we also

339
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,440
used to have some kind of

340
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:55,610
shorter answer type

341
00:08:55,610 --> 00:08:56,750
questions. These have

342
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:57,800
been taken from the old

343
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,480
exam, put together into

344
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:02,180
one assessment. And

345
00:09:02,180 --> 00:09:03,350
that's also an assessment

346
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,730
now, that gets delivered

347
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,380
later on in the year. And

348
00:09:06,410 --> 00:09:07,550
it comes from a question

349
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:09,590
bank. So you'll need to

350
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:12,170
know everything,

351
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:13,970
everybody will be

352
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,470
delivered a different

353
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,060
kind of exam a different

354
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,530
set of questions, even

355
00:09:18,530 --> 00:09:18,860
though they're all

356
00:09:18,860 --> 00:09:19,730
multiple choice, you'll

357
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:21,680
get a random set from the

358
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:22,460
question bank and there's

359
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:23,780
about 150 questions in

360
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,040
the question bank, if

361
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:25,550
you've managed to

362
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:27,020
memorise them all great,

363
00:09:27,890 --> 00:09:29,240
but the reality is that

364
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:30,320
that's unlikely; so

365
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:31,250
you'll still need to have

366
00:09:31,250 --> 00:09:32,330
some understanding of the

367
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,410
user experience behind

368
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:37,130
it. Then we've also got a

369
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:39,950
larger assignment type of

370
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,540
sessional, if you like,

371
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:46,190
exam, whereby you're

372
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:46,970
doing it remotely, you're

373
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:48,020
doing it asynchronously,

374
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:49,430
you'll have a set period

375
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,510
of time to do that in.

376
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,300
But again, the questions

377
00:09:53,300 --> 00:09:54,110
are all different, you'll

378
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:54,890
be presented with

379
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:55,850
different questions.

380
00:09:59,180 --> 00:10:00,560
So this update, as I say,

381
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:01,610
is a major update that

382
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:05,180
COVID-19 forced. It's

383
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,020
been put off because it

384
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:06,830
was a large amount of

385
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:07,970
work and I wanted to do

386
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:09,140
this in a graduated step,

387
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:10,670
but because we're all you

388
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:12,230
know, sitting around in

389
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,700
our homes in lockdown,

390
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,100
then I've got quite a lot

391
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,360
of time now to do this.

392
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,410
Now, of course, I'm not

393
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:19,580
really in a swanky

394
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,810
lecture theatre come

395
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,460
conference room, I'm here

396
00:10:22,460 --> 00:10:23,600
in the front room of my

397
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,920
house, it's the front box

398
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:26,420
bedroom trying to do this

399
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:27,860
in front of a green

400
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,660
screen. It's just me in

401
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:30,650
front of a green screen.

402
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:31,670
There's nothing to see

403
00:10:31,670 --> 00:10:33,320
here. Okay, let's get

404
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:34,820
back to the lecture.

405
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,620
So the assignments and

406
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:40,870
testing have changed. And

407
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:42,400
reality is that even

408
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,270
though we've been forced

409
00:10:43,270 --> 00:10:44,530
to make these changes by

410
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:46,090
the by the situation,

411
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:48,130
it's better, that better.

412
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,000
They're the kind of

413
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,900
assignments and testing

414
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:50,740
that I've wanted to do

415
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
for a long time but

416
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:52,420
couldn't get the approval

417
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,120
for now all bets are off,

418
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,290
we've suddenly got the

419
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:58,540
got what we need. So I'm

420
00:10:58,540 --> 00:10:59,920
really pleased that that

421
00:11:00,010 --> 00:11:00,940
we've been able to get

422
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:01,690
these assignments and

423
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,610
testing changes through.

424
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,740
And they're just the kind

425
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,760
of things we wanted. So

426
00:11:07,330 --> 00:11:07,960
this is going to be

427
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:10,480
really good. Now, we

428
00:11:10,510 --> 00:11:11,890
won't be physically co

429
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:12,850
present, so we won't be

430
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:13,930
in the same room. I

431
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:14,860
imagine we wouldn't be

432
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,880
anywhere at this point in

433
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,200
the same room. But we'll

434
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:17,830
have two different

435
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,310
things. We'll have

436
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,900
asynchronous work, and

437
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:20,980
we'll have synchronous

438
00:11:20,980 --> 00:11:22,540
work. So asynchronous

439
00:11:22,540 --> 00:11:23,890
means that it's this kind

440
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,240
of thing, video lectures.

441
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,070
They'll also be

442
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,600
asynchronous discussion

443
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,250
topics via discord

444
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,350
probably. So you will

445
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,580
leave questions that you

446
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:38,470
need answering etc. and I

447
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:40,060
will answer them over the

448
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:40,840
period of week but we

449
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:43,000
won't be on the platform

450
00:11:43,030 --> 00:11:43,690
probably at the same

451
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:45,970
time. And then we'll have

452
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:48,310
synchronous sort of

453
00:11:49,090 --> 00:11:50,260
lectures. So those

454
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,220
synchronous lectures will

455
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,120
probably be occurring

456
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,230
about once a week.

457
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:56,140
They'll be us via zoom or

458
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:57,100
something like this.

459
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,840
We'll be going through

460
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,640
example, But also

461
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,540
there'll be discussion

462
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:02,830
there. And we'll see why

463
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,990
you can't skip these or

464
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,890
that you can't get good

465
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:06,820
marks if you do skip

466
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,440
them. So just think about

467
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:10,540
that. And these will be

468
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,670
live, and they'll be face

469
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:13,330
to face and there won't

470
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:14,350
be recorded because

471
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:15,460
they're more about you

472
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:16,780
guys participating if you

473
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:19,300
really don't come then

474
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,280
the core components of

475
00:12:21,280 --> 00:12:22,660
the of the work, which is

476
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,010
already pre recorded,

477
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:26,530
like this, should be fine

478
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,820
for you to understand

479
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:28,450
what's happening.

480
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:30,670
So there'll be a

481
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:32,770
synchronous open surgery

482
00:12:32,770 --> 00:12:33,850
for one hour a week, it

483
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:36,070
could be via zoom. It

484
00:12:36,070 --> 00:12:36,940
will be once a week, as I

485
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:39,520
say, and it means that we

486
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:41,650
can actually chat face to

487
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:43,930
face. Now, you won't need

488
00:12:43,930 --> 00:12:46,990
to be there if you don't

489
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,650
want to be simply. You

490
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:52,030
don't need to be at the

491
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:53,500
surgery. That's just a

492
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,120
spot where if you feel

493
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,630
that you need some

494
00:12:55,630 --> 00:12:56,590
feedback, you need

495
00:12:56,710 --> 00:12:57,310
something that's

496
00:12:57,310 --> 00:12:58,210
synchronous, something

497
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,530
that is where we're

498
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:01,330
talking to Together, then

499
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:02,410
that's fine, you can turn

500
00:13:02,410 --> 00:13:03,730
up to that. But it's you

501
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:04,690
don't have to go there.

502
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:05,620
It's really just for

503
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,790
problems or to go through

504
00:13:06,790 --> 00:13:07,990
examples or if there's

505
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,620
something you didn't

506
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:10,840
quite understand. Then we

507
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,700
can go and talk about it

508
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:14,140
on the on that zoom call,

509
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:15,100
and I'll be there you

510
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:16,810
just, you'll get the code

511
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,890
sign-in when you like it

512
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:18,880
anytime you write within

513
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:20,200
that one hour, but it

514
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,640
will finish on the hour,

515
00:13:21,640 --> 00:13:22,480
so you know, you need to

516
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,630
come beforehand. Don't

517
00:13:25,630 --> 00:13:26,260
leave it till the very

518
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,010
last moment.

519
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:31,690
Okay, so we're done.

520
00:13:32,020 --> 00:13:32,620
You'll notice that

521
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:33,370
there's a transcription

522
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,090
available with this

523
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,740
video, the transcription

524
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,030
has been made also into

525
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:38,530
subtitles, and there'll

526
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,580
be a transcript and

527
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:41,380
subtitles for every video

528
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,580
that you see. So make

529
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,570
sure if you need those

530
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,480
subtitles, make sure that

531
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,140
you switch them on in

532
00:13:47,140 --> 00:13:48,520
your particular video

533
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,960
viewer. Okay, so, have a

534
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,420
good rest of your week,

535
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,010
and we'll see you in the

536
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:57,520
next one.
