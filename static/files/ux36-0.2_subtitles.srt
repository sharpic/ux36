1
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,210
Welcome again to User Experience

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:14,610
UX36. And this is the assignment

3
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,810
overview. So it's still

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:17,310
logistical, but I want to tell

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:18,360
you about the assignments, why

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:19,860
they were created, and really,

7
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,200
why they were put together and

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:24,840
what they're there to test. So

9
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:28,260
there's two types of assignments

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:29,220
that we'll be working with.

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:29,910
There's the formative

12
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:31,380
assignment, which is for

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,090
feedback only. So you don't have

14
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:34,800
to do it. It's optional. If you

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,060
don't want to do it, you don't

16
00:00:36,060 --> 00:00:39,240
need to, but you must do it

17
00:00:39,240 --> 00:00:41,100
within the allocated time. We

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,510
can't do it afterwards because

19
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:44,100
we can't reallocate the TA

20
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,230
resources to help with the

21
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:47,880
marking and the feedback to you.

22
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,370
So, you must if you want to do

23
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:51,300
it, you must do it within the

24
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:53,760
first period of time that we

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,850
talked about in the lectures in

26
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,600
the video lectures. After that,

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,410
there's two summative

28
00:01:01,410 --> 00:01:02,880
assignments. So after you've had

29
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,260
your feedback, you can do the

30
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,490
two summative assignments which

31
00:01:05,490 --> 00:01:06,660
contribute to the overall mark,

32
00:01:06,660 --> 00:01:08,940
they're 15% each. So it's

33
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:10,410
reasonable to get those under

34
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:12,150
your belts before you go into

35
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:18,300
the main tests, if you like in

36
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:20,010
the main part of the work now

37
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:23,580
the assignments themselves, you

38
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:24,900
should, you should try and do

39
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:28,980
them. I think trying to get them

40
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:31,170
all done by the end of reading

41
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,220
week, okay, so you'll get a good

42
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:36,990
idea of what you need to do and

43
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:38,520
how you need to approach them by

44
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,310
coming to the discussion

45
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:44,520
lectures and the the kind of the

46
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,200
consolidation lectures and you

47
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,540
should be able to do them, you

48
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,070
know, probably within the first

49
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:52,830
six to seven weeks, okay? So try

50
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:54,120
and get those out of the way if

51
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,470
you possibly can and if you feel

52
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,850
uncomfortable with it, that's

53
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,930
what then that's what they're

54
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:00,990
meant to be there for. Now, the

55
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,120
first one is the formative

56
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,890
assignment, discussion topic.

57
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,790
This is understanding and

58
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:08,100
scoping and defining the user

59
00:02:08,100 --> 00:02:09,780
experience. And the reason why

60
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,550
this was created this paper was

61
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:14,460
selected is because it really

62
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:16,920
shows that in 2009, you'll find

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:18,300
out that even today, nobody

64
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,130
really knows what UX is. So the

65
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:21,840
good point is, if you don't know

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,910
what it is, I don't know what it

67
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:24,720
is we're making our own

68
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,460
definitions. The good thing is

69
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,490
that nobody's wrong. But we do

70
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:30,840
need to define the terms when

71
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,950
we're in discussions with other

72
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,600
people of what we actually think

73
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:37,200
this is, this is about. So this

74
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:39,660
survey approaches is a way of

75
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,240
kind of understanding what UX

76
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:44,130
is. And so what happened was

77
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,670
that Effie Law, who is the the,

78
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:50,130
the main author of this, went to

79
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,600
the CHI conference, which is a

80
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,910
major conference for Computer

81
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,740
Human Interaction, and she

82
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:58,050
wanted to ask the people who

83
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,100
came there what they thought it

84
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,060
was, or at least there was

85
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,080
questionnaire that they were

86
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,630
able to rank what, with

87
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:04,830
agreement or disagreement rank,

88
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,580
what they thought it was really

89
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:11,490
about on a number of different

90
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:13,410
metrics and a number of

91
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,800
different axis. And so I think

92
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,870
it's important for us to kind of

93
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,070
read through this to understand

94
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:22,890
what the, what the outcomes were

95
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:26,070
and also what the negative

96
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:27,750
points were, really what were

97
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:30,300
the failings of this survey

98
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:33,060
approach. And we do use this as

99
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,770
a critically important part part

100
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:36,840
of the course. So let's not get

101
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:38,250
serious, and let's not, you

102
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:40,140
know, stray too far that this is

103
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:42,120
a good bit of work. But it's a

104
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,710
good idea for us to chat about

105
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,300
this in the context of this

106
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:46,770
formative assignment so that you

107
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:48,990
can kind of pick up what you

108
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:50,670
need to do so that you'll get

109
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,760
feedback from from this first

110
00:03:53,609 --> 00:03:55,289
The next one is the summative

111
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,620
kind of dry run and assignments,

112
00:03:55,289 --> 00:03:56,579
assignment. So this is the first

113
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:56,910
but it's optional.

114
00:03:56,579 --> 00:03:57,599
summative assignment and it's

115
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,649
designing the star user

116
00:03:58,649 --> 00:04:00,869
interface. So star user

117
00:04:00,869 --> 00:04:02,249
interfaces were really where all

118
00:04:02,249 --> 00:04:05,189
GUIs began. It's something that

119
00:04:05,189 --> 00:04:06,629
was created out of Xerox PARC wh

120
00:04:06,629 --> 00:04:09,869
ch was an awesome place and sti

121
00:04:09,869 --> 00:04:10,979
l is. But it's an awesome pl

122
00:04:10,979 --> 00:04:12,869
ce where there was a lot of exc

123
00:04:12,869 --> 00:04:14,549
llent work going on through th

124
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:16,469
 60s 70s and 80s. And indeed, th

125
00:04:16,469 --> 00:04:18,269
s is really where where Stev

126
00:04:20,129 --> 00:04:21,389
 Jobs took his inspiratio

127
00:04:21,389 --> 00:04:23,519
 for the way that the the Mac sh

128
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:28,829
uld work. This kind of idea of

129
00:04:28,829 --> 00:04:30,359
GUIs and how it all fits togethe

130
00:04:30,359 --> 00:04:31,799
, it was really proved at Xe

131
00:04:31,799 --> 00:04:34,469
ox PARC. And they did this oth

132
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:35,669
r thing that was really aweso

133
00:04:35,669 --> 00:04:36,359
e, called dogfooding. 

134
00:04:36,359 --> 00:04:39,599
hereby they would all use the 

135
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:43,679
tar user interface on all of th

136
00:04:44,189 --> 00:04:46,169
 machines in their in Xerox PAR

137
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:47,879
 in their company. So therefore

138
00:04:48,119 --> 00:04:50,549
 they proved it by actually usi

139
00:04:50,549 --> 00:04:53,249
g it. So really good, really

140
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,109
good. article here on designing

141
00:04:55,109 --> 00:04:56,219
it and something you should t

142
00:04:56,219 --> 00:04:57,809
ke forward to your user testing

143
00:04:57,809 --> 00:04:58,979
if you possibly can.

144
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,460
The final one is the second is

145
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,930
the second summative assignment.

146
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:12,490
And this is voice loops as

147
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:13,780
corporative aids in space

148
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,580
shuttle mission control. The

149
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,840
reason why I selected this one

150
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,700
is because I wanted you guys to

151
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,100
think that UX sounds sort of

152
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,200
nice and fluffy, and it feels

153
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,270
like apps, it feels like iOS, it

154
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:26,380
feels like Android, it feels

155
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,330
like that kind of thing. But

156
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:30,520
that's not all it is. UX is

157
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,770
really critically important in

158
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,280
lots of computational situations

159
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:38,080
and device based situations,

160
00:05:38,230 --> 00:05:40,660
including the computational work

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:45,250
here, on the space shuttle. Also

162
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,620
on computational work, for

163
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,460
things like nuclear power

164
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,810
stations, and how the safety

165
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:51,940
critical systems such as fly by

166
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,250
wire aircraft can really screw

167
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,320
up. If we don't get the user

168
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:57,820
experience right in a faithful

169
00:05:57,820 --> 00:05:59,470
way. And when I say user

170
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,820
experience We'll be coming to

171
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:01,780
this in the future, of course.

172
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,100
But when I say user experience,

173
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,230
I don't just mean, you know,

174
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,150
does it look nice, that's not

175
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:09,190
the whole point. User Experience

176
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:11,140
is about the full experience of

177
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,610
the user, how the control flow

178
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:16,480
works, etc, etc. And even down

179
00:06:16,480 --> 00:06:18,790
in devices to the way things

180
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:20,200
look and the way things feel,

181
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,490
because we have a tactile sense.

182
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:23,110
So we want to make sure that

183
00:06:23,110 --> 00:06:24,910
this is an important, you know,

184
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,680
we want to make sure that we

185
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:28,330
don't get things wrong, even

186
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,470
outside, if you like, of the

187
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,500
software. So, there are a number

188
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,790
of apocryphal stories, you know,

189
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,770
one of them is that you'll see

190
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,390
some images of nuclear power

191
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:38,860
plants where they have different

192
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:41,650
beer taps on the top of each of

193
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,140
the control arms. And that's

194
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,280
because the control arms all

195
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,390
look the same. And so they

196
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,010
didn't know they couldn't

197
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,240
differentiate or remember which

198
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,410
one was which. So they put a

199
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:52,240
beer tap on it, or at least to

200
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,350
be a pull on it with a little

201
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:54,940
sign on each of them telling

202
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,020
them what they actually did,

203
00:06:56,260 --> 00:06:57,640
after the event after the

204
00:06:57,640 --> 00:06:58,600
nuclear power station has

205
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,130
actually gone into service.

206
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:01,330
Because the people who are

207
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:02,770
operating just remember it's too

208
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,360
complex, okay? They all look the

209
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:07,090
same. That's not what you want

210
00:07:07,090 --> 00:07:08,080
when it comes to something

211
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,820
that's a safety critical as the

212
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,320
controls of a nuclear power

213
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:13,330
station, right. And you could

214
00:07:13,330 --> 00:07:15,130
also say the same thing about

215
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:24,490
the the Airbus crash from Brazil

216
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:27,970
to Paris, whereby, in that

217
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:32,320
particular accident, you had the

218
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:35,470
ability for a pilot who was the

219
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:37,570
copilot to be doing one thing,

220
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:38,950
ie putting inputs into the

221
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:40,450
system which were going down,

222
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:43,120
and for another pilot to be

223
00:07:43,330 --> 00:07:45,100
pulling back so that they would

224
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,720
go up. And of course, these two

225
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,570
things start to interact with

226
00:07:49,570 --> 00:07:51,610
each other. They didn't think

227
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:53,320
when they designed the system,

228
00:07:53,470 --> 00:07:54,310
that if somebody is already

229
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:55,660
putting control inputs in one

230
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,100
way that we should at least say

231
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:58,420
you're the one is barred from

232
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:00,100
doing it and you have to do

233
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:00,880
something else, you know, there

234
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,590
has to be a switch that changes

235
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:04,240
from one to the other. This is

236
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,320
because in typically in

237
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:07,690
aircraft, you would say, one

238
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:09,730
pilot would say I have control

239
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:11,200
and the other person say, yes,

240
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,280
you have control, that'd be a

241
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:13,990
confirmation, verbal

242
00:08:13,990 --> 00:08:16,060
confirmation. But in situations

243
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,050
which are highly stressful,

244
00:08:17,050 --> 00:08:17,950
where you're not sure what's

245
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,620
happening, those situations

246
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:22,180
sometimes get missed, okay,

247
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,260
because it's stressful we're

248
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:24,910
people. So therefore, it's a

249
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:26,980
good idea to have user

250
00:08:26,980 --> 00:08:28,450
experience designers in there as

251
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:29,410
well to make sure that the

252
00:08:29,410 --> 00:08:30,940
safety critical systems work.

253
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:36,780
So how are we going to approach

254
00:08:36,780 --> 00:08:39,330
these? Well, the thing that you

255
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,710
need to think about is it's not

256
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:43,350
a summary of the paper because I

257
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:44,430
can read it and get a summary.

258
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:46,650
What I want is your insights in

259
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:49,110
the summary. So tell me why the

260
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:51,000
paper is important. Why should

261
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,940
What should I know and why is it

262
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,520
important. And how does this

263
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:58,230
paper affect our development?

264
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,580
What insights does the paper

265
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:01,560
have and How do they affect us?

266
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,760
Can we use the paper to our

267
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,320
advantage? The reason why we ask

268
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,180
these questions is because these

269
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,500
are the kind of things that your

270
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,330
bosses will need you to answer.

271
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,180
They are not UX experts, they

272
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,440
are not research and development

273
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,090
experts like you are going to be

274
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:16,290
when you get into their company,

275
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:18,270
they will ask you for a brief on

276
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:20,040
a paper, they expect you to give

277
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,440
the value added. They can read

278
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:23,490
the paper, they're smart enough,

279
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:25,140
they're your boss, right? What

280
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,700
you need to give them is your

281
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,710
expertise which your training

282
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,390
which they haven't had. And you

283
00:09:30,390 --> 00:09:32,190
can only do that by knowing the

284
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,280
area and be able to synthesise

285
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,750
information from other parts of

286
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:39,060
your knowledge with this

287
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,440
knowledge of the paper that

288
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:42,180
you're reading into something

289
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,820
that's useful to those to those

290
00:09:46,050 --> 00:09:47,430
people, those technical people,

291
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:50,280
those business people. So

292
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:54,240
summarising the paper you need

293
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,710
to do a little bit of that but

294
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,150
that is not all you need to do.

295
00:09:57,150 --> 00:09:58,350
You need to analyse it you need

296
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:00,060
to evaluate it to to come up

297
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:02,580
with With some 250 words, so

298
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,820
it's very brief insight. Now,

299
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,680
you don't need to focus on the

300
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,090
whole paper, you can give a

301
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,320
brief overview and then say,

302
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,610
this is the most important thing

303
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,830
for us this bit and ignore the

304
00:10:13,830 --> 00:10:16,170
rest. That's okay. It's not you

305
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,550
can't say everything in 250

306
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:19,500
words, you need to be able to

307
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,720
understand what is important for

308
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,180
you and for your company and

309
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:26,610
therefore summarise it to that

310
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
to that company, okay, outcome.

311
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,220
So, I think that the important

312
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:38,640
thing here is that there is a

313
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:40,020
skill to summarising a paper.

314
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:42,090
But you I need to add the

315
00:10:42,090 --> 00:10:43,890
analysis in the evaluation. You

316
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:45,150
need to come up with your 250

317
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:47,070
words as an industry standard.

318
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,380
But you need to add your own

319
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,140
insight you need to add your own

320
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,650
understanding to this kind of

321
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:57,840
work so that the people who have

322
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,640
employed you get the value added

323
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,440
of your expertise, what you're

324
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,150
trying to say is, I'm an expert.

325
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,010
And I'm going to tell you about

326
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,540
this particular paper within the

327
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,610
light of my expertise. That's

328
00:11:08,610 --> 00:11:09,660
what we're trying to get to.

329
00:11:09,930 --> 00:11:10,710
It's not enough to just

330
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:15,360
summarise it. So like I say, in,

331
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,070
you know, you interpret the

332
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,660
paper, you add your insight,

333
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,790
your expertise, in this context,

334
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:22,140
it's about the UX course. So you

335
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,090
add your expertise in you being

336
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,730
UX, you might draw in bits from

337
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,870
the other courses that you've

338
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,450
taken, that's also perfectly

339
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:32,280
acceptable to make those links

340
00:11:32,310 --> 00:11:33,690
and synthesise that information

341
00:11:33,870 --> 00:11:36,060
into this particular work. Okay.

342
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,650
It's difficult to not just

343
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,120
produce a summary so I suggest

344
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,470
you get one of your friends to

345
00:11:43,470 --> 00:11:45,150
read over it, see whether they

346
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,350
think it's a summary or see

347
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:47,310
whether they think there's some

348
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,870
value added in there as well.

349
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,060
Okay. Think to yourself, could

350
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,800
anybody have just read this

351
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,760
paper and then summarise it? Is

352
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,130
my 250 words could anybody have

353
00:11:59,130 --> 00:12:00,840
written them that read the paper

354
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,100
and write my 250 words. If

355
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,380
that's true, your 250 words

356
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:07,080
aren't correct. If it isn't true

357
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,490
if you if you actually think so

358
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,690
far, no, actually, there's lots

359
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:10,560
of different bits that I've

360
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:11,490
pulled from different areas in

361
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:14,040
it. That's what we want. Also,

362
00:12:14,070 --> 00:12:16,200
make sure you reference things.

363
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,210
Okay? Make sure that you take

364
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:20,190
other sources and reference them

365
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:21,840
in your work. I say three or

366
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:23,940
four sources of you can have

367
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,200
some informal sources, you can

368
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,400
have more formal sources like

369
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:28,080
papers, put them into your work.

370
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:30,150
So it allows you to say why you

371
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,710
think something why you've said

372
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:33,840
something, typically, you'd

373
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:36,090
write the 250 words, and then

374
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:37,260
you go back and put in the

375
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,780
references where you think the

376
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,550
reference backs up what you've

377
00:12:41,580 --> 00:12:44,160
said, it kind of tells people

378
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,290
why you think something with

379
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:49,560
cold hard facts. Okay? Not just

380
00:12:49,590 --> 00:12:50,910
Oh, I thought of it one day and

381
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,410
so that's, that's why I wrote

382
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:53,100
it. Okay.

383
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,170
As I said previously in the

384
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,540
welcome. late marks the

385
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,460
university rules apply. So let's

386
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:03,110
not be thinking that we can do

387
00:13:03,110 --> 00:13:05,540
anything about those late marks.

388
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:08,720
You know, it all goes into the

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,010
university systems and it's

390
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,480
really out of our hands as soon

391
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:12,590
as those marks come in there.

392
00:13:13,370 --> 00:13:15,770
And the marking rubric, you can

393
00:13:15,770 --> 00:13:17,300
see this online, and it's the

394
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,610
only thing that the TAs get to

395
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:21,560
look at, including, there's no

396
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,430
hidden way to mark an

397
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,860
assignment, all the market

398
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:29,600
instructions are available for

399
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,300
you to see and for the TA is to

400
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:36,290
use to mark with. Okay, so you

401
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:38,360
need 35% for structure and

402
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:40,250
argument, knowledge and

403
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,170
understanding 35% and original

404
00:13:42,170 --> 00:13:45,380
thought 30% Okay, so that's

405
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:46,940
where we're going going for for

406
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:49,010
this. And, and you can see what

407
00:13:49,010 --> 00:13:50,480
those things mean what it means

408
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,300
to get, you know, a 35% as

409
00:13:53,300 --> 00:13:55,670
opposed to a 5% in structure and

410
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,280
argument on the website. So all

411
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,530
that's open. You can also see it

412
00:14:00,530 --> 00:14:02,150
in your Turn-It-In submission,

413
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,260
but it's all there on the

414
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,670
website. So there's nothing

415
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:06,320
hidden from you, everything is

416
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,110
explicit. You should be

417
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,510
expecting to get the marking and

418
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:14,900
feedback within two weeks. So

419
00:14:14,900 --> 00:14:16,070
you can do better in the next

420
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:17,360
one. So that's why I would

421
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,890
suggest that you kind of stages

422
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:20,270
these every two weeks do or

423
00:14:20,270 --> 00:14:21,680
maybe or when you get the marks

424
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:26,720
back do one so that by the by

425
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:27,950
the time you get to the kind of

426
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:28,790
third one, you've had the

427
00:14:28,790 --> 00:14:30,170
experience of doing too and you

428
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:31,460
can hopefully get better and

429
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,460
better marks as you go on. We've

430
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:36,020
also got real examples from

431
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:37,310
previous years. These are all

432
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,780
online as well so you can see

433
00:14:38,780 --> 00:14:40,730
what the best look like from

434
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,890
previous years. The thing you

435
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:44,420
should also know about both the

436
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:47,030
assignments and the and the

437
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:52,310
exam. I mark them based on what

438
00:14:52,310 --> 00:14:55,880
I think is appropriate for you,

439
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,220
what's the correct Mark? Okay.

440
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:01,070
I'm not trying to be harsh I'm

441
00:15:01,070 --> 00:15:03,590
not trying to be easy. I'm

442
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:05,150
trying to be dispassionate. I'm

443
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:06,950
trying to make sure that, that

444
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:09,410
what you're writing here is what

445
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,690
both I would expect. But also

446
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:15,380
make sure that for other people,

447
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:17,630
they've, you know, if they've

448
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,820
written a really good, excellent

449
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:20,840
piece of work, they should be

450
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,830
getting better marks than you,

451
00:15:21,830 --> 00:15:23,450
right? I mean, if you haven't

452
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:26,450
done that, okay, so I'm not

453
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,560
trying, I'm trying to be as

454
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,790
objective and dispassionate

455
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:29,840
about this as possible in that

456
00:15:29,840 --> 00:15:31,070
this means that it's possible

457
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:33,680
for people to get 100% there's

458
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,160
no 95% or 99% because nothing's

459
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:40,490
perfect or 90%. You can get 100%

460
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,980
in these assignments. Last year

461
00:15:42,980 --> 00:15:45,110
in the exam, I had two people no

462
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,450
had one person who got 100% in

463
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:49,340
the exam, I could not find a

464
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:51,590
way. I could not find anything

465
00:15:51,590 --> 00:15:53,270
wrong with it. Okay, they got

466
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:55,970
100%. Likewise, though, for the

467
00:15:55,970 --> 00:15:57,290
assignments and for the exams

468
00:15:57,350 --> 00:15:59,810
you also can easily get 10's

469
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:02,210
Okay, it's very difficult unless

470
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:03,680
you don't turn up to get zero,

471
00:16:03,830 --> 00:16:04,940
it's very difficult if you

472
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,830
submit an assignment that's

473
00:16:06,830 --> 00:16:08,060
actually got words in it, that

474
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:09,920
makes sense in some way. But

475
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,940
you're going to get more than

476
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:14,180
zero, but it could happen. So,

477
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:16,640
just be mindful of the fact that

478
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:17,900
if you put in a good effort and

479
00:16:17,900 --> 00:16:19,250
you do the work, you'll get the

480
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,920
marks. There's no scaling,

481
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,480
weighting or anything else.

482
00:16:23,510 --> 00:16:25,430
Okay? You get the marks if you

483
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,910
do good work. Okay, and again,

484
00:16:28,940 --> 00:16:32,240
we don't so hopefully, the next

485
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:33,770
lecture that that you should be

486
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:34,850
attending certainly in the next

487
00:16:34,850 --> 00:16:36,770
lecture, that I'll be giving the

488
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,850
first lecture for this course is

489
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:40,070
a face to face lecture now that

490
00:16:40,070 --> 00:16:42,200
will either be via zoom or by

491
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:45,020
one of your other connection

492
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:47,540
tools. Or it might even be who

493
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:50,750
knows, actually co present in a

494
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,010
lecture theatre, you never know!
