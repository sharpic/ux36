The course runs as a 'flipped classroom' in that I expect you to read the notes before the lecture, and then in the lecture we discuss the topics covered in the notes as well as possible exam questions, problems you are having etc.

Assessment is via both coursework and tests. Coursework comprises two short assignments (reading and a 250 word report each) worth 30% total (2 x 15%). The two tests are therefore worth 70% and comprises ten multiple choice questions and five/six longer questions. Both coursework and tests are completed by electronic assessment and all questions are compulsory.
